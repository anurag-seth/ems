# ems
Employee Management System


If installing project for the first time then create 'ems' database in the localhost and paste the path of the database in the application properties(with valid user id and password), uncomment out the ddl.auto = create line and then comment out ddl.auto = update.
After the project gets run copy the insertdummydata text from resources folder and run the sql query which will create a super admin dummy user with **id - anujseth@argusoft.com** and **password- anuj123**.
Comment out the ddl.auto=create line and re run the frontend and backend and you can add new user now according to your use.
